# myAnimeDB

<!-- <h1>Description</h1> -->
A simple web app that provides info about the animes that match the search terms that the user uses

I wanted to put my freshly learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills to a little test
so I decided to make a web app and came up with the idea of a simple web app
that uses the "Anime DB" API to get info about an anime of the user's choice.

You are free to use the code for whatever you like.
